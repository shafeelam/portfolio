    <!-- 1. Custom Web Development -->
    <h3>1. Custom Web Development</h3>
    <p>At Brandilux, <a href="https://brandilux.in/web-development/custom-web-development/" target="_blank">custom web development</a> means crafting digital experiences that are both visually engaging and technically robust. Every website is built from the ground up to reflect your goals, target audience, and business identity. Our approach blends user-centric design, responsive layouts, and high-performance code to create websites that stand out for all the right reasons.</p>
    <p>We focus on mobile responsiveness, fast loading speeds, accessibility, and clean, semantic code. Whether you need a sleek portfolio, a full-scale business website, or an e-commerce platform, our builds are designed for scalability, security, and long-term performance. Each line of code is optimized for SEO and usability — ensuring your website not only looks good but also performs seamlessly.</p>
    <p>User experience (UX) is at the heart of our process. Through intuitive navigation, structured content, and clear visual hierarchy, we make it easy for users to explore and convert. With Brandilux, you get more than a website — you get a digital asset that works for your business around the clock.</p>

    <!-- 2. CMS Integration -->
    <h3>2. CMS Integration</h3>
    <p>We believe that managing a website should be simple, not stressful. Our <a href="https://brandilux.in/web-development/cms-integration/" target="_blank">CMS integration</a> services empower clients to manage their own content with ease. We work with platforms like WordPress, Joomla, and modern headless CMSs such as Strapi and Contentful to deliver intuitive, future-ready solutions.</p>
    <p>Each CMS is customized to your specific workflow — with flexible templates, easy media handling, and intuitive dashboards. Our goal is to streamline your content management, reduce dependency on developers, and ensure your team can update the website efficiently while maintaining brand consistency.</p>
    <p>Security and scalability are central to our approach. We implement proper permissions, regular updates, and role-based access to protect your data and content. With training and documentation provided, you retain full control while knowing expert support is just a call away.</p>

    <!-- 3. Web Application Development -->
    <h3>3. Web Application Development</h3>
    <p>Some businesses need more than static pages — they require dynamic, interactive systems that simplify operations or improve engagement.

From client dashboards and booking systems to analytics tools and customer portals, we build web apps that are secure, fast, and scalable.</p>

    <h3>5. Web Design</h3>
    <p>At Brandilux, <a href="https://brandilux.in/web-product-design/web-design/" target="_blank">web design</a> is more than visual appeal — it’s about storytelling and brand experience. Every design is grounded in strategy, crafted to reflect your values, and engineered to convert visitors into customers.</p>
    <p>We start with research, user flows, and wireframes, gradually evolving them into high-fidelity prototypes. Micro-interactions, animations, and intuitive navigation are added to create delightful experiences. Our aesthetic decisions are informed by usability principles, ensuring balance between beauty and performance.</p>
    <p>The result? Websites that are visually stunning, highly accessible, and built to perform flawlessly across all devices. Brandilux design blends creativity and logic to turn your brand vision into a meaningful digital presence.</p>

    <!-- 6. Product Design -->

We craft digital products that are both visually coherent and practical to use.
