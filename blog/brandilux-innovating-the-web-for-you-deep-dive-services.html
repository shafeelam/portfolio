    <!-- Services -->
    <h2>Comprehensive Services — What Brandilux Delivers</h2>
    <p>At Brandilux, I provide a complete range of services to help businesses and individuals establish a strong digital presence. Each service is tailored to your unique needs, combining creativity, technical precision, and strategic thinking to deliver measurable results. Below is a deeper look into each core offering.</p>

    <!-- 1. Custom Web Development -->
    <h3>1. Custom Web Development</h3>
    <p>Building a website isn’t just about code — it’s about creating a digital experience that aligns with your brand’s goals and engages your audience. At Brandilux, I specialize in <strong>custom web development</strong> that’s scalable, secure, and performance-driven. Every project begins with understanding your business objectives, target audience, and competitive landscape, allowing me to craft a solution that is uniquely yours.</p>
    <p>I focus on <strong>responsive design</strong>, ensuring your site functions seamlessly across all devices. Performance optimization, accessibility compliance, and clean, semantic code are at the heart of every build. Whether you need a simple landing page, a content-rich corporate site, or a complex e-commerce platform, I combine modern frameworks and best practices to deliver websites that are fast, reliable, and future-proof.</p>
    <p>Beyond functionality, I emphasize <strong>user experience (UX)</strong>. Navigation, interactions, and page layouts are thoughtfully structured to guide visitors toward meaningful actions, such as inquiries, purchases, or subscriptions. The result is a website that not only looks professional but also drives measurable business outcomes.</p>

    <!-- 2. CMS Integration -->
    <h3>2. CMS Integration</h3>
    <p>Managing content shouldn’t require a developer for every update. I provide <strong>CMS integration</strong> services that empower clients to control and update their own content with ease. I work with popular platforms like <strong>WordPress, Joomla</strong>, as well as modern <strong>headless CMS solutions</strong> like Strapi or Contentful, depending on your project needs.</p>
    <p>Beyond installation, I <strong>customize the backend</strong> to simplify workflows, making it easier for teams to manage pages, media, and blog posts without technical complexity. Templates, content types, and dashboards are tailored to your workflow, reducing errors and ensuring consistency across the site.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I focus on <strong>security and scalability</strong>. Updates, permissions, and role-based access are configured to protect your site from vulnerabilities while keeping it flexible enough to grow with your business. Training and documentation are also provided so your team can maintain the website independently while still having professional support when needed.</p>

    <!-- 3. Web Application Development -->
    <h3>3. Web Application Development</h3>
    <p>Some projects require more than static pages — they demand <strong>interactive, functional applications</strong> that solve real business problems. Brandilux delivers <strong>web application development</strong> for scenarios like customer portals, dashboards, booking systems, and internal tools.</p>
    <p>Each application is built with a focus on <strong>performance, usability, and security</strong>. I use modular architecture, responsive design, and cross-browser testing to ensure your application works seamlessly across devices. Features are implemented to scale, allowing your product to evolve alongside your business.</p>
    <p>I also prioritize <strong>integration and automation</strong>. APIs, databases, and server logic are connected in ways that streamline workflows and reduce manual effort. By combining robust back-end functionality with intuitive front-end interfaces, users enjoy smooth, efficient experiences while your business benefits from optimized operational processes.</p>

    <!-- 4. API and Backend Integration -->
    <h3>4. API and Backend Integration</h3>
    <p>Modern digital solutions rely heavily on interconnected systems. At Brandilux, I provide <strong>API and backend integration</strong> services that link your website or application with external services like payment gateways, CRMs, and analytics platforms.</p>
    <p>I also develop <strong>custom backend solutions</strong> to manage complex workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and store data securely. This ensures your front-end interface runs smoothly while your business logic is robust, scalable, and maintainable.</p>
    <p>Security, performance, and reliability are always prioritized. With careful attention to data validation, authentication, and error handling, your systems function flawlessly, protecting sensitive information while enabling seamless user experiences.</p>

    <!-- 5. Web Design -->
    <h3>5. Web Design</h3>
    <p>Good design is about more than aesthetics — it’s a <strong>strategic tool</strong> for communication, engagement, and conversion. I create <strong>web designs</strong> that capture your brand’s essence and resonate with your audience. Every aspect, from typography and color schemes to layout and interaction design, is crafted with intention.</p>
    <p>The process begins with research and wireframes, followed by high-fidelity prototypes that visualize the final user experience. I incorporate <strong>micro-interactions</strong>, motion design, and intuitive navigation to enhance usability and delight users.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I ensure that designs are not only visually compelling but also <strong>aligned with performance standards</strong>. A beautiful website that is slow or difficult to navigate can undermine your brand — that’s why I combine aesthetics with speed, accessibility, and responsive design to create websites that engage and convert.</p>

    <!-- 6. Product Design -->
    <h3>6. Product Design</h3>
    <p>Designing a digital product is about <strong>solving problems</strong> for real users. Brandilux approaches <strong>product design</strong> by understanding user needs, behaviors, and goals, creating interfaces that are functional, intuitive, and aesthetically coherent.</p>
    <p>I focus on <strong>user flows, prototyping, and testing</strong>, iterating designs to ensure every interaction feels natural and seamless. From clickable buttons to complex dashboards, each element is carefully crafted to minimize friction and enhance usability.</p>
    <p>By combining design thinking with technical feasibility, I ensure that digital products not only look great but are also practical, accessible, and easy to use. This reduces errors, boosts satisfaction, and drives engagement.</p>

    <!-- 7. Web Maintenance -->
    <h3>7. Web Maintenance</h3>
    <p>Launching a website is only the beginning — long-term <strong>web maintenance</strong> ensures your investment continues to deliver results. Brandilux offers ongoing support that includes <strong>updates, security monitoring, performance optimization, and content refreshes</strong>.</p>
    <p>I proactively track site health, implement security patches, and optimize performance metrics to keep your website fast and reliable. Regular backups, accessibility checks, and analytics reviews are also part of the maintenance process, ensuring your site evolves with user expectations and technological changes.</p>
    <p>Maintenance isn’t just about fixing issues — it’s about <strong>future-proofing</strong> your website. With ongoing attention, your digital presence remains professional, competitive, and capable of supporting your business growth over time.</p>

    <!-- Process -->

    <p>Brandilux follows a predictable, client-friendly process that balances creativity with delivery discipline:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Discovery & Research:</strong> Stakeholder interviews, user persona mapping, competitor analysis, and defining success metrics.</li>

    </ol>
